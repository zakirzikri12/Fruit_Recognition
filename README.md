DurianFruit-Classification-App-with-Custom-TensorFlow-Model


Learn how to code your neural network in Python, then deploy it in an Image Classification App using a custom model created from Google Colab and deploy it in a mobile application 

The fruit recognition system aims to enhance the user experience by accurately classifying durian and other fruits, while also offering additional interesting features. This system not only identifies the fruit and provides its name, but also enables users to learn more about different types of fruits. Additionally, users can conveniently check the current market prices for durian and directly ask the chatbot for more detailed information about various fruits. By leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques, this system utilizes appropriate algorithms to improve its functionality. The classification method employed involves collecting a dataset of fruits to develop a robust model. there are 5 classes of durian fruits which is D197, D24, D175, D2 and D101.  This system offers four key functionalities:

1) Users can identify fruits by capturing their images,
2) Detailed information about the identified fruits is displayed, 
3) Users can interact with the chatbot to obtain fruit-related information, 
4) Users can access the latest market prices.
